# Descriptive name for the workflow as it appears in the GitHub Actions tab
name: Python CI with Linting

# Defines the events that trigger this workflow
on:
  push:
    # Runs whenever code is pushed to these specific branches
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    # Runs whenever a pull request is opened or updated against these branches
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  # Single job named 'lint' to handle code quality checks
  lint:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    # Step 1: Clone the repository onto the runner so the workflow can access the code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a specific Python environment
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    
    # Step 3: Prepare the environment with necessary linting tools
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pylint
    
    # Step 4: Fast, lightweight linting check
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # Stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names (Critical issues)
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # Check for style violations with a slightly more relaxed line length
        flake8 . --count --max-line-length=127 --statistics
    
    # Step 5: Deeper static analysis check
    - name: Lint with pylint
      run: |
        # Analyzes app.py and fails the job if the score drops below 8.0/10
        pylint app.py --fail-under=8.0
